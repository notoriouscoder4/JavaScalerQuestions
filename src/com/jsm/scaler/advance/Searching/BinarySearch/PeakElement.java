An array element is peak if it is NOT smaller than its neighbors.    For corner elements, we need to consider only one neighbor. We ensure that answer will be unique.    NOTE: Users are expected to solve this in O(log(N)) time.    Problem Constraints    1 <= |A| <= 100000    1 <= A[i] <= 10^9    Input Format    The only argument given is the integer array A.    Output Format    Return the peak element.    Example Input:    Input 1:    A = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]    Input 2:    A = [5, 17, 100, 11]    Example Output:    Output 1:     5    Output 2:     100    Example Explanation:    Explanation 1:     5 is the peak.    Explanation 2:     100 is the peak.    */    private static int peakElement(int[] A) {        if (A.length == 1)            return A[0];        int left = 0;        int right = A.length - 1;        while (left <= right) {            int mid = (left + right) / 2;            // it means if mid is at last index then peak element will be max of A[mid] and A[mid - 1]            if (mid == A.length - 1)                return Math.max(A[mid], A[mid - 1]);            // it means if mid is at first index then peak element will be max of A[mid] and A[mid + 1]            else if (mid == 0)                return Math.max(A[mid], A[mid + 1]);            // mid > previous element  and mid > next element that is the answer            if (A[mid - 1] < A[mid] && A[mid] > A[mid + 1])                return A[mid];                // it means peak element will be in left half of the array, so we move mid to left by right = mid - 1            else if (A[mid - 1] > A[mid])                right = mid - 1;                // it means peak element will be in right half of the array, so we move mid to right by left = mid + 1            else                left = mid + 1;        }        return -1;    }    public static void main(String[] args) {        int[] A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};        System.out.println(peakElement(A));    }}
